# KATA Brief

Create a program, which, given a valid sequence of rolls for one line of American Ten-Pin Bowling, produces the total score for the game. Here are some things that the program will not do:

Problem Description
1. We will not check for valid rolls.
2. We will not check for correct number of rolls and frames.
3. We will not provide scores for intermediate frames.
Depending on the application, this might or might not be a valid way to define a complete story, but we do it here for purposes of keeping the kata light. I think youâ€™ll see that improvements like those above would go in readily if they were needed for real.

# Bowling

1. You have to provide valid sequence of rolls and valid number of rolls
2. Example sequence 
*  [4,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,4,5] - Score 90
*  [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5] - Score 150
3. Please see attached video to see how to use app.

# How to run app

1. You would need xcode IDE
2. Open .xcodeproj with xcode IDE
3. Press cmd+R or press PLAY button from top-left corner
4. Please see attached video on how to use app.

# Design pattern

1. MVVM
2. Factory
3. SOLID principles

# Development methodology
